# Bring the Innovation Circuit to Your School

The Innovation Circuit is a collective of short events that introduce beginners to making with computers. We work with schools to bring the event to their school and provide all the resources they'll need.

An Innovation Circuit event looks something like this:

**3:45pm -** Doors open, participants check in & receive welcome packet
**4:00pm -** Opening ceremony (normally a couple of quick speeches plus going over logistics)
**4:15pm -** Free making time begins (participants use resources to build things and the team roams around to help out)
**4:15pm -** First group of workshops begin in smaller rooms or in the corners of the room. 
**5:15pm -** Second group of workshops begin in smaller rooms or in the corners of the room. 
**6:45pm -** Participants invited on stage to participate in Show & Tell (a charismatic host makes the experience great)
**7:15pm -** Pizza party time! (or another food type party). Don't worry we fund this.
**7:45pm -** Celebration ceremony, where some (approx. 5) top projects are showcased and they get a mini prize.
**8:00pm -** Goodbyes and thank yous. 

> The goal of the workshops is to give students who don't know what to make a chance to build something. Our workshops are designed to give them a base product that they can build on top of. Our workshops are also designed to be very easy to run.
