<h1> Bring the Innovation Circuit to Your School </h1>

The Innovation Circuit is a collective of short events that introduce beginners to making with computers. We work with schools to bring the event to their school and provide all the resources they'll need.

An Innovation Circuit event looks something like this:

**3:45pm -** Doors open, participants check in & receive welcome packet

**4:00pm -** Opening ceremony (normally a couple of quick speeches plus going over logistics)

**4:15pm -** Free making time begins (participants use resources to build things and the team roams around to help out)

**4:15pm -** First group of workshops begin in smaller rooms or in the corners of the room. 

**5:15pm -** Second group of workshops begin in smaller rooms or in the corners of the room. 

**6:45pm -** Participants invited on stage to participate in Show & Tell (a charismatic host makes the experience great)

**7:15pm -** Pizza party time! (or another food type party). Don't worry we fund this.

**7:45pm -** Celebration ceremony, where some (approx. 5) top projects are showcased and they get a mini prize.

**8:00pm -** Goodbyes and thank yous. 

> The goal of the workshops is to give students who don't know what to make a chance to build something. Our workshops are designed to give them a base product that they can build on top of. Our workshops are also designed to be very easy to run.

## What an Innovation Circuit Event Looks Like

It's hard for us to put the vibe of an Innovation Circuit event in words, so here are some photos from Innovation Week (the predecessor to the Innovation Circuit) that capture the atmosphere of an Innovation Circuit event best:

## Why Innovation Circuit?

### Students Love It

A reason why Innovation Circuit is a unique initiative is that students love it! We have received a high community engagement and participation through our two years of experience in organising successful events. Students love our events as they can relate to them and our events are highly engaging whilst being educational and informative.

### Easy to Launch

The delivery of our events to schools is simple for schools, and does not need any cost needed from the school. Instead, all we need is a provided venue and day-of-manpower, and we will be able to run Innovation Circuit with provided electronics hardware, food, workshops, and prizes in no time!

### Students Learn A Lot

Not only are Innovation Circuit events great fun, they're also very informative with students learning a lot. Our workshops were developed in consultation with the Hack Foundation, an international organisation that has years of experience developing a programming curriculum. They have been designed to teach new topics in relatable ways for students.

### Attracts All Sorts of Students

## Resources Provided

We provide every Innovation Circuit event with the following:

- A kit of electronics hardware (worth approx. USD $5,000) for students to use during the event
  - It includes things such as robots and Arduinos
  - We also provide an inventory system
- We provide the budget for food for attendees
- We provide welcome packets full of swag from our sponsors
- Workshops to deliver to attendees
- Mentorship and guidance from our experienced team
- Marketing materials

All we ask that you provide is a large room and the day-of manpower. 

## The Process

We ask that you apply to host an event with us at least six weeks in advance of the day you'd like to host it.

The process that will follow is as follows:

**6 weeks out:** we have our first meeting and introduce the entire project to you. These meetings will become weekly. We define how you'd like your event to look like. 

**4 weeks out:** We provide you with our final set of custom resources (such as marketing materials and workshops). We run through them in our meeting.

**2 weeks out:** We confirm the event details and order the food.

**1 week out:** You collect our physical resources from us.

**Day-of:** We send a representative to your event to support you if logistically possible.

This process is incredibly flexible and we expect it to be different for every event we support.
